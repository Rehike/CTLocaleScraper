# CoffeeTranslation Locale Scraper

This converts information from the [Unicode CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/) to [CoffeeTranslation](//github.com/YukisCoffee/CoffeeTranslation) definition files.

Currently, this covers the conversion of:

- [x] Language names (to `language_names.i18n`)
- [x] Country names (to `country_names.i18n`)
